This directory contains code from the Constructive Provability Logic project.

 - MinimalCPL - a tethered, minimal (no explicit negation) constructive 
   provability logic that was the focus of the technical report "Principles of 
   Constructive Provability Logic." Both natural deduction and sequent 
   calculus versions are presented, and their equivalence is established.

 - TetheredCPL - a tethered, intuitionistic constructive provability logic with
   negation, shared by the IMLA workshop submission and the journal version of
   "Constructive Provability Logic." Both natural deduction and sequent 
   calculus versions are presented, and their equivalence is established.

 - FocusedCPL - a less-tethered, polarized, intuitionistic presentation of 
   constructive provability logic is presented in focused sequent form only.
   This is the version of CPL that is most adequate as the foundation of a 
   logic programming language.

 - DetetheredCPL - a less-tethered intuitionistic constructive provability logic
   with negation is presented in natural deduction form and proved to be 
   equivalent to the focused presentation in FocusedCPL. The IMLA workshop 
   paper instead presented a non-focused sequent calculus, and while this 
   system exists in the version control system, it has been removed here in 
   favor of the focused version.
