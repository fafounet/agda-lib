This is a version of the 
[http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.6273 structural focalization] development, which I 
had previously played out [http://twelf.org/wiki/Focusing in Twelf], played
out in Agda. Here are the parts.

 - Foc.agda - focused sequent calculus, weakening (Section 2)
 - Cut.agda - cut admissibility (Section 3)
 - Identity.agda - focal substituion, identity expansion (Section 4)
 - Admissible.agda - unfocused admissibility lemmas (Section 5.1)
 - Unfoc.agda
   - unfocused sequent calculus, weakening (Section 1)
   - de-focalization (Section 2.3)
   - focalization (Section 5.2)
   - cut and identity for the unfocused sequent calculus (Section 5.3)
